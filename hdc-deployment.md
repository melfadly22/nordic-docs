#### Health Data Connector -> Deployment

## Application Installation

The Healthcare Connector technology can be implemented on AWS and Azure using a deployment template and subsequent configuration for connectivity. The connector is hosted entirely on the cloud and is capable of integrations with our clientâ€™s cloud and on-premise software and databases.

The Nordic team will complete the deployment and initial configuration on your behalf. During this time we will also provide training on how to utilize the software for new configurations and general maintenance. Nordic can also provide complete day-to-day maintenance of the application via a support contract.

## Application Training

The Healthcare Connector supports interactions with our clients' existing software via SDK, allowing clients to treat the connector as a microservice within their software ecosystem. The SDK communicates the the Healthcare Connector via API calls. SDK libraries are not available in all languages; Nordic can provide an SDK in a given software language upon request.

Because the application is a no-code tool we do not require your software engineering team to be involved in some product configurations. Depending on your integration preferences, product configuration and maintenance can be completed by a Business Analyst or similar role. Integration with the product via SDK or maintenance of the cloud environment may require additional skillsets.
