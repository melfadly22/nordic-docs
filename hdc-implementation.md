## Consulting

Nordic has deep experience assisting our clients end-to-end with FHIR, SMART on FHIR, and HL7 implementation processes. From registering the application to implementing connectivity and data mapping, the Nordic team will advise our clients and their healthcare partners on the most appropriate approach for long-term success.

## EPIC

Nordic is available to assist with a healthcare system implementation. For Epic healthcare organizations, the software is implemented using a [Home - Epic on FHIR](https://fhir.epic.com/)  or [Home - App Orchard](https://apporchard.epic.com/) application that is registered by the client. Cerner and other EHR vendors follow similar processes.
