#### Registry Direct -> Overview

## Automation

### Data Submissions

Registry Direct is a Software-as-a-Service application that automatically gathers, transforms, validates, and sends population health metrics and quality measures to third-party registries on behalf of our partnering hospital organizations.

## Fast Implementations

While a typical, in-house solution might take 400-600 hours from IT staff, report writers, and clinical experts to implement a manual extract, Registry Direct takes less than 40 hours to implement. Once live in a facility, it becomes trivial to extend the same product and processes to other facilities in a hospital organization.

Currently, Registry Direct is officially partnered with the American Heart Association and Healogics to provide fast, easy, out-of-the-box implementations. If your organization is interested to integrate with another third-party registry, let us know! A custom solution could become a standard integration.
